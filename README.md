## Installation

 Installing dependencies and run gulp(not dev support)

    $ npm run init

 Running with dev support (watching changes when saving files and restarting the simulator, only for IOS)
    $ npm run start:dev

 Testing gulfile file in case if you want, first you need install [iron-node](https://github.com/s-a/iron-node) and:

    $ npm run test:gulp


  Thanks (:
